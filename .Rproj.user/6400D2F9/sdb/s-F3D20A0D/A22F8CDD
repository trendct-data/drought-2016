Our scripts may be too technical for the average reader, but we make it accessible because we believe it is important to be as transparent as possible about our methodology so our work can be checked or expanded upon.

It'd also be nice if you gave me a heads up: [@abtran](http://www.twitter.com/abtran) or abtran@trendct.org.\n0",
